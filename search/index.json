I‚Äôve still been working on Project Five every single day. I decided to focus more on actually making the game and recording gameplay footage rather than editing and posting updates. That said, there‚Äôs been a ton of progress behind the scenes that I can‚Äôt wait to start sharing again.\nToday, I‚Äôm excited to show a new combat preview that highlights where the game‚Äôs roguelike mechanics truly start to shine. Each ring you equip now comes with a random buff, adding a whole new layer of depth and replayability to the gameplay.\nHere are some examples of what you can expect:\nüî• Damage buffs for specific elements ‚ö° Reload speed reductions for faster attacks ü¶æ Augment buffs that directly enhance the hand ‚Äî reserved only for legendary rings\nLegendary rings drop with their unique, fixed augment buff, while common buffs can stack, making your character incredibly powerful with the right combinations.\nAlongside the combat overhaul, I‚Äôve also updated the HUD, refined enemy behavior, and made improvements to the background visuals to give the world more atmosphere and depth.\nThere‚Äôs still so much more I want to share ‚Äî but for now, check out the new combat video! I hope you enjoy the video and stay tuned for more updates.\n#IndieDev #GameDev #PixelArt #Devlog #PoisonAbilities #DanceMinigame\n","date":"2025-10-22T00:00:00Z","image":"https://arnoldant.github.io/blog/p/game-devlog-10/22/2025/cover_hu_ee88325f19ca5a6d.jpg","permalink":"https://arnoldant.github.io/blog/p/game-devlog-10/22/2025/","title":"Game Devlog 10/22/2025"},{"content":"This week‚Äôs update brings some exciting new systems and enemy tweaks to the game.\nüü¢ Slime Improvements\nSlimes now hop with varied timers for more natural movement\nCleaner, more efficient code and updated animations\nParticle effects make them feel livelier than ever\n‚ò†Ô∏è Poison Abilities\nAdded a poison grenade and a ticking poison effect\nSpewer enemies are immune, adding a layer of strategy\nü§∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Player Tumble Animation\nNew mid-air tumble animation decreases hitbox size, perfect for dodging attacks üíÉ Dance Room Expansion\nAmbient lighting, new scenery, and dancing characters\nA nod to some beloved cats, bringing a fun, lighthearted change of pace\nWhat‚Äôs next?

To get some hands-on practice, I chose a sample sales dataset and set out to build a dashboard that could highlight trends in products, territories, and revenue. What started as an experiment quickly turned into a fun project with some solid insights.\nThe Dataset For this project, I used the AdventureWorks sample sales database. It contains information about products, territories, subcategories, and sales over time.\nBefore building the visuals, I had to do a little data prep:\nConverted month numbers into month names (so January, February, etc. instead of 1, 2, 3).\nChanged fields like sales amount into a proper currency format.\nMade sure territories like Southwest, Central, Northeast were mapped correctly.\nThis step made the visuals more intuitive and ready for analysis.\nBuilding the Dashboard I started by creating a few queries in Power BI‚Äôs Power Query Editor:\nMost sold product ‚Üí which bike had the highest sales volume.\nLeast sold product ‚Üí which product underperformed.\nSubcategory breakdown ‚Üí total units sold by bike type (mountain, road, touring, etc.).\nSales by territory ‚Üí performance across regions like the United States, Canada, UK, France, and more.\nFrom there, I built out the visuals:\nA bar chart showing monthly sales trends.\nCard visuals highlighting the best and worst sellers.\nA pie chart to illustrate the sales split by bike subcategory.\nA map visual to show sales by territory.\nAlong the way, I learned how to:\nSort months properly using ‚ÄúSort by Column.‚Äù\nAdd filters (slicers) so I could view results by year.\nClean up the design by removing chart backgrounds and adding a company logo.\nKey Insights A few interesting things stood out:\nSome bike subcategories were clear winners, dominating total units sold.\nThe U.S. territories (Central, Southwest, Northeast, etc.) made up the bulk of sales, but there was meaningful activity in Canada and Europe as well.\nThe monthly breakdown showed predictable peaks and dips, which could be useful for future forecasting.\nDesign Choices I wanted the dashboard to feel clean and modern, so I:\nRemoved unnecessary borders and backgrounds.\nUsed cards for quick KPIs (best seller, worst seller).\nPlaced the logo in the corner to give it a branded look.\nArranged visuals logically: trends on the left, categories and maps on the right.\nWhat I Learned This project helped me:\nGet comfortable with Power BI‚Äôs query editor.\nPractice using filters and slicers to add interactivity.\nThink about dashboard design in terms of both analysis and presentation.\nCompared to Tableau, Power BI felt more integrated with Microsoft tools and had a smoother workflow for data prep. Tableau still feels stronger for quick visual design, but Power BI shines when it comes to reporting and sharing in a business environment.\nNext Steps If I were to expand this project, I‚Äôd like to:\nAdd more KPIs (like revenue by customer segment).\nBuild a forecasting model to predict future sales.\nTry embedding the interactive dashboard into my website instead of just sharing images.\nConclusion This was my first end-to-end project in Power BI, and I‚Äôm really happy with how it turned out. It‚Äôs one thing to follow tutorials, but working with an actual dataset and creating visuals from scratch is the best way to learn.\nIf you‚Äôre just starting with Power BI, I highly recommend picking a dataset that interests you and giving it a try!\nSQL code used:\nSELECT TOP 1 People.FirstName, People.LastName, SalesTeam.SalesYTD FROM Sales.SalesPerson SalesTeam JOIN Person.Person People ON People.BusinessEntityID = SalesTeam.BusinessEntityID ORDER BY SalesTeam.SalesYTD DESC SELECT Year(OrderDate) SaleYear, MONTH(OrderDate) SaleMonth, SUM(TotalDue) TotalSales FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader Header GROUP BY Year(OrderDate), MONTH(OrderDate) SELECT ProductTable.Name ProductName, OrderTable.ProductID, SUM(OrderQty) TotalUnitsSold FROM Sales.SalesOrderDetail OrderTable JOIN Production.Product ProductTable ON ProductTable.ProductID = OrderTable.ProductID JOIN Production.ProductSubcategory ProductSubCategory ON ProductTable.ProductSubcategoryID = ProductSubCategory.ProductSubcategoryID JOIN Production.ProductCategory ProductCategory ON ProductSubCategory.ProductCategoryID = ProductCategory.ProductCategoryID WHERE ProductCategory.Name = 'Bikes' GROUP BY OrderTable.ProductID, ProductTable.Name ORDER BY TotalUnitsSold DESC SELECT ProductSubcategory.Name SubCategoryName, SUM(OrderQty) TotalUnitsSold FROM Sales.SalesOrderDetail OrderTable JOIN Production.Product ProductTable ON ProductTable.ProductID = OrderTable.ProductID JOIN Production.ProductSubcategory ProductSubCategory ON ProductTable.ProductSubcategoryID = ProductSubCategory.ProductSubcategoryID WHERE ProductSubcategory.Name LIKE '%bike%' AND ProductSubcategory.Name NOT LIKE '%bike rack%' AND ProductSubcategory.Name NOT LIKE '%bike stand%' GROUP BY ProductSubcategory.Name ORDER BY TotalUnitsSold DESC SELECT st.Name AS TerritoryName, st.CountryRegionCode, SUM(soh.TotalDue) AS TotalSales FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader soh JOIN Sales.SalesTerritory st ON soh.TerritoryID = st.TerritoryID GROUP BY st.Name, st.CountryRegionCode ORDER BY TotalSales DESC ","date":"2025-09-10T00:00:00Z","image":"https://arnoldant.github.io/blog/p/building-my-first-sales-dashboard-in-power-bi/cover_hu_78396c71526d058c.png","permalink":"https://arnoldant.github.io/blog/p/building-my-first-sales-dashboard-in-power-bi/","title":"Building My First Sales Dashboard in Power BI"},{"content":"This week‚Äôs update brought some big changes to the game, both in terms of enemies and new gameplay systems.\nü¶¥ The Guard Skeleton\nI introduced a brand-new enemy type: the Guard Skeleton.\nEquipped with a spear and shield\nShield can block attacks, making combat more strategic\nPatrols the area and chases the player once spotted\nThis enemy is meant to feel tougher and more tactical than the regular ones, adding variety to encounters.\nüíö Slime Overhaul\nThe Slime also received an upgrade.\nCleaner, more efficient code behind the scenes\nImproved animations for smoother movement\nAdded particle effects to give it more personality\nIt feels a lot more alive now, and it‚Äôs fun watching it bounce around.\nüï∫ The Dancing Room\nThe biggest addition is the Dancing Room, a brand-new minigame!\nInspired by DDR-style rhythm gameplay\nFeatures dance animations for the player character\nAdds a lighthearted, fun change of pace from the usual combat\nThis was a big step toward making the game feel more varied and unique.\nWhat‚Äôs Next?\nI\u0026rsquo;m planning to work on the ring abilities and to add more variety to the environment, so stay tuned!\nThanks for following along with the development.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of everything I‚Äôve added since last time:\nüè† Placeholder Main Menu\nThe project finally has a main menu! It‚Äôs simple for now, but it includes the basics: Start, Options, and Exit. This small step makes the game feel more like a complete experience instead of just jumping straight into gameplay.\n‚ù§Ô∏è Classic Zelda-Style Health System\nI‚Äôve swapped out the old placeholder health bar for a heart-based system, inspired by the classics. Each heart represents a chunk of health, and losing them feels satisfying and clear in a way that fits the game‚Äôs retro-inspired style.\n‚ö° New Lightning Abilities\nThe main character‚Äôs powers continue to evolve with two huge new additions:\nTriple Lightning Strike ‚Äì With the lightning ring equipped, you can now call down three bolts of destruction, chaining your power together for massive damage.\nAerial Lightning Slam ‚Äì Jump into the air and crash down, unleashing a thunderous lightning blast that strikes both enemies and the ground itself.\nBoth moves make combat feel more dynamic and give you more tools for chaining attacks together.\nüóùÔ∏è Secret Areas \u0026amp; Treasure\nExploration just got more rewarding. I‚Äôve added hidden rooms tucked away behind destructible terrain. If you‚Äôre curious enough to search, you‚Äôll find secret chests waiting with valuable loot. This adds a nice layer of discovery and makes exploration more engaging.\nüëæ New Enemy: The Spewer\nA fresh foe enters the battlefield: the Spewer.\nIt burrows underground to reposition.\nPops up to spit poison projectiles.\nForces you to stay mobile and adapt.\nIt‚Äôs a fun twist compared to the melee-focused enemies so far and adds variety to combat encounters.\nüí° Lighting \u0026amp; Shadows\nTo improve atmosphere, I‚Äôve implemented dynamic lighting with terrain casting shadows. This small change makes the world feel richer and adds depth to caves, secret areas, and combat arenas.\n‚úÖ What‚Äôs Next?\nWith combat, exploration, and visual polish all improving, the game is slowly shaping into something cohesive. Next up, I‚Äôll be refining the feel of combat even more and expanding enemy variety.\nThanks for following along! This week‚Äôs changes made a huge difference in how the game plays and feels.
