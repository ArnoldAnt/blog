It’s been a while since I last shared a project here. Life got busy, and I stepped away from posting updates for longer than I planned. I’m sorry for the hiatus, but I’m excited to be back with something a little different this time.

While most of my past posts have focused on data analysis, SQL, and R, I’ve recently revisited a long-time passion of mine: game development. Over the past few months, I’ve been working on a 2D pixel video game with roguelite mechanics, lightning-based abilities, and a story that balances lighthearted moments with a touch of tragedy. It’s been an amazing creative challenge, completely different from my usual analytical projects, but just as rewarding.

I’ll be sharing more updates on this game and new data-driven projects soon. Thanks for sticking around during the break, and I’m excited to bring more to this space again!

Software used: Python, Godot Engine, Aseprite
