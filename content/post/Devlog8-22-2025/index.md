It’s been a packed week of development, and the game is starting to feel more alive with each update. Here’s a breakdown of everything I’ve added since last time:

🏠 Placeholder Main Menu

The project finally has a main menu! It’s simple for now, but it includes the basics: Start, Options, and Exit. This small step makes the game feel more like a complete experience instead of just jumping straight into gameplay.

❤️ Classic Zelda-Style Health System

I’ve swapped out the old placeholder health bar for a heart-based system, inspired by the classics. Each heart represents a chunk of health, and losing them feels satisfying and clear in a way that fits the game’s retro-inspired style.

⚡ New Lightning Abilities

The main character’s powers continue to evolve with two huge new additions:

* Triple Lightning Strike – With the lightning ring equipped, you can now call down three bolts of destruction, chaining your power together for massive damage.

* Aerial Lightning Slam – Jump into the air and crash down, unleashing a thunderous lightning blast that strikes both enemies and the ground itself.

Both moves make combat feel more dynamic and give you more tools for chaining attacks together.

🗝️ Secret Areas & Treasure

Exploration just got more rewarding. I’ve added hidden rooms tucked away behind destructible terrain. If you’re curious enough to search, you’ll find secret chests waiting with valuable loot. This adds a nice layer of discovery and makes exploration more engaging.

👾 New Enemy: The Spewer

A fresh foe enters the battlefield: the Spewer.

* It burrows underground to reposition.

* Pops up to spit poison projectiles.

* Forces you to stay mobile and adapt.

It’s a fun twist compared to the melee-focused enemies so far and adds variety to combat encounters.

💡 Lighting & Shadows

To improve atmosphere, I’ve implemented dynamic lighting with terrain casting shadows. This small change makes the world feel richer and adds depth to caves, secret areas, and combat arenas.

✅ What’s Next?

With combat, exploration, and visual polish all improving, the game is slowly shaping into something cohesive. Next up, I’ll be refining the feel of combat even more and expanding enemy variety.

Thanks for following along! This week’s changes made a huge difference in how the game plays and feels. Can’t wait to show you what’s coming next!
