Hello! Iâ€™m Anthony Arnold, a data enthusiast and a passionate problem solver based in Miami, FL.

With a Google Data Analysis Certificate and a strong skill set in Python, Tableau, SQL, and more, I am well-equipped to tackle complex data challenges. I have hands-on experience in data analysis projects, including a Florida COVID-19 Data Analysis Project, where I utilized spreadsheets, Tableau, and mathematical modeling techniques to extract valuable insights.

I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead in the field of data analysis. By leveraging my skills, I am committed to delivering data-driven solutions that drive meaningful outcomes.

I would like to thank you for visiting my website. Feel free to explore my portfolio and reach out to me with any inquiries or collaboration opportunities. Let's unlock the power of data together!
