Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹

Itâ€™s been a little while since my last post, but donâ€™t worry! Iâ€™ve still been working on Project Five every single day. I decided to focus more on actually making the game and recording gameplay footage rather than editing and posting updates. That said, thereâ€™s been a ton of progress behind the scenes that I canâ€™t wait to start sharing again.

Today, Iâ€™m excited to show a new combat preview that highlights where the gameâ€™s roguelike mechanics truly start to shine. Each ring you equip now comes with a random buff, adding a whole new layer of depth and replayability to the gameplay.

Here are some examples of what you can expect:

ðŸ”¥ Damage buffs for specific elements
âš¡ Reload speed reductions for faster attacks
ðŸ¦¾ Augment buffs that directly enhance the hand â€” reserved only for legendary rings

Legendary rings drop with their unique, fixed augment buff, while common buffs can stack, making your character incredibly powerful with the right combinations.

Alongside the combat overhaul, Iâ€™ve also updated the HUD, refined enemy behavior, and made improvements to the background visuals to give the world more atmosphere and depth.

Thereâ€™s still so much more I want to share â€” but for now, check out the new combat video!
I hope you enjoy the video and stay tuned for more updates.
