This is a final project for Topological Data Analysis, a class I took in Spring 2023. The project consisted of analyzing the real projective plane (RP2), which is a topological space that can be portrayed in a 3-D space. This project did involve teamwork and coding using the topology packages in R studio. Although the computation portion has been lost, here you can find the code and a piece of the presentation.

Software used: R Studio, Microsoft Powerpoint
