This weekâ€™s update brought some big changes to the game, both in terms of enemies and new gameplay systems.

ðŸ¦´ The Guard Skeleton

I introduced a brand-new enemy type: the Guard Skeleton.

* Equipped with a spear and shield

* Shield can block attacks, making combat more strategic

* Patrols the area and chases the player once spotted

This enemy is meant to feel tougher and more tactical than the regular ones, adding variety to encounters.

ðŸ’š Slime Overhaul

The Slime also received an upgrade.

* Cleaner, more efficient code behind the scenes

* Improved animations for smoother movement

* Added particle effects to give it more personality

It feels a lot more alive now, and itâ€™s fun watching it bounce around.

ðŸ•º The Dancing Room

The biggest addition is the Dancing Room, a brand-new minigame!

* Inspired by DDR-style rhythm gameplay

* Features dance animations for the player character

* Adds a lighthearted, fun change of pace from the usual combat

This was a big step toward making the game feel more varied and unique.

Whatâ€™s Next?

I'm planning to work on the ring abilities and to add more variety to the environment, so stay tuned!

Thanks for following along with the development. If youâ€™ve got ideas, feedback, or just want to cheer the project on, Iâ€™d love to hear from you.
