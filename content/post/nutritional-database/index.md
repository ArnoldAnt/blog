With the expansive selection of food items necessary for survival, it is important to understand the breakdown of nutrients within them. Complexity plagues the nutritional makeup of even the simplest food products, causing avoidance and confusion when diving deeper into dietary facts. In this project, the aim is to bridge the gap between the foods loved by all and the nutrients nested within them. Creating a relational database to hold nutrient and product information would act as a reliable resource to monitor, update, and add relations that easily connect foods with their nutritional facts. Users can query the database to find foods based on various criteria such as fiber content, calorie amount, fat content, iron content, etc. The implementation of a nutritional database would also promote healthier lifestyles, making it a very useful tool to use daily.

Software used: SQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Google Suite
