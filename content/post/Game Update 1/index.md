I’m excited to share the first gameplay video from my 2D pixel roguelite game! Right now, the character has a basic punch, a grapple swing mechanic, and just three rooms to explore, but it’s already fun to see everything coming together.

In this clip, you’ll get a glimpse of the movement and combat mechanics, including grappling through rooms and defeating the first slime enemy. It’s still early days, but seeing the mechanics in action really brings the world I’m building to life.

I’ll be sharing more updates as the game grows, with new abilities, enemies, and levels. It’s exciting to finally give a peek behind the curtain at how the game is shaping up!

Software used: Python, Godot Engine, Aseprite
