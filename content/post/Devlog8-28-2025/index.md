🔥 Devlog Update – New Abilities, Sticky Terrain & Dungeon Progress! 🔥

Since the last update, I’ve been grinding away under the hood and adding a ton of new mechanics and systems to the game:

⚔️ Code & Systems Updates

* Reworked player states and grapple system for smoother transitions.

* Improved how special terrain interacts with movement.

* Optimized under-the-hood code for better performance.

🏰 Dungeon Expansion

* Added a new dungeon room with unique layouts.

* Special terrain now plays a bigger role in exploration and challenge.

🔥 New Fire Abilities

* Flame Double Jump – launch yourself with a fiery boost! Does damage to unfortunate souls beneath you.

* Fire Shotgun – unleash a blast of pellet-like flames to clear enemies up close.

🕸️ Sticky Terrain

* A new environmental hazard: sticky ground that reduces your mobility and jump height, forcing more careful platforming and combat decisions.

There’s still a lot to come, but I’m super excited about the direction the game is taking. Let me know what you think of the new abilities and terrain system!
